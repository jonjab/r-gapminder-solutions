This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 



# Episode 1

```{r}
# evaluating simple math
1 + 100
```

```{r}
# order of operations
3 + 5 * 2
```

## Let's make some formatting
And start adding some text here. That's the advantage of using a notebook,
I get to put formatted commentary in along the way.

```{r}
getwd()
```
## More complex
* functions evaluate stuff in the parens
* we can do comparisons
* can execute a line at a time, or the entire box.
```{r}
exp(0.5)
1 != 2
1 == 1
```

## Variables
Let's always use the assignment operator like this:
` x <- 1:5 `
so that we don't get confused with equals signs. = ==

```{r}
x <- 1:5
```

`ls()` gives you all your defined values:
```{r}
ls()
```
And a more verbose version that shows hidden files:
```{r}
ls(all.names=TRUE)
```

### note:
putting in the name of an object outputs the object.
```{r}
x
ls
```

### keep yourself clean
the `rm()` function gives you the same 
results as hitting the broom in RStudio
as long as you pass it the list of functions.

This is a nice example of a 'nested' function call.
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

## Challenge 2 & 3
```{r}
mass <- 47.5
age <- 122
mass <- mass * 2.3
age <- age - 20

mass > age


```

## challenge 5: clean up
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```


# Episode 2: Project Organization
We need to invoke some libraries to get work done, including
saving our output to PDF (this knitr part is not in the lesson yet)

```{r}
library(tinytex)
```

Now would be a great time to save you work.

# Episode 3: Getting help

And we will cover several other functions, like `c()` and `paste()`

```{r}
# both of these pull up a help card
?ls()
help(ls)

```

Vignettes are another sort of help.
Running it empty give you a list of everything available
```{r}
vignette()
```
And a double question mark will give you a fuzzy list of help
```{r}
?? ggp
```




Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
